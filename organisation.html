                <h3>Fred and Martie’s soupkitchen</h3>
                <p>
                    Fred & Martie’s Soup Kitchen, a recognized Public Benefit and Non-Profit Organization, is committed to aiding the underprivileged in Claremont, west of Johannesburg, South Africa. Over 43 years ago, Fred and Martie Hughes, motivated by their own experiences with poverty, identified a pressing need in the community and decided to take action. When they moved to Claremont in March 1981, they brought with them both their belongings and a deep compassion and commitment to make a positive change.

The initiative began modestly with Martie feeding children from a small table outside their home, using sample packs of soya mince provided by Fred’s workplace. What started as a simple act of kindness rapidly expanded as more people sought assistance, revealing the vast need within the community. Martie was driven by her own experiences of poverty, understanding the pain of hunger all too well.

On the first day, five children came to eat. By the third day, the number surged to 200, leading to congestion that even required traffic management. Martie’s dedication and love for her community resulted in hundreds being nourished and uplifted. For many years, the community looked to Fred and Martie not just for sustenance but for hope and support.

After Martie’s passing in February 2008, her wish for the continued care of the children was honored by her daughter, Yolindie, who took over the operations as Fred’s health declined. Yolindie vowed to continue Martie’s legacy, ensuring that no child would be forgotten or go hungry. Today, Fred & Martie’s Soup Kitchen remains steadfast in its mission, continuing to serve the community with the same passion and love that defined its beginnings.

                <h3>Hotel Hope Ministries</h3>
                <p>
                    BABIES IN NEED This initiative includes a family-style Child and Youth Care Centre (CYCC) and a registered foster home, accommodating up to 24 children. It advocates for adoption, encouraging more South African families to adopt.

                    Hotel Hope Ministries is dedicated to families, ensuring that every child experiences the love and security of a family. Our goal is to place orphaned and abandoned children into adoptive homes as swiftly as possible, working closely with social workers and child protection agencies. While the adoption process can be lengthy, and there are often more children needing families than available homes, we care for them in family-style settings in the interim. We aim to make each child feel valued and loved rather than just a number in an institution.
                    
                    Our CYCC consists of two warm, semi-detached houses in Melville, each with three bedrooms, lovingly decorated by volunteers to feel like regular family homes. They feature lounges filled with toys, gardens with swings and jungle gyms, and dining rooms where families can eat together. The CYCC began operating in January 2011 after thorough preparation and approval from local authorities, ensuring compliance with all necessary regulations.
                    
                    On Mandela Day, 18 July 2019, we opened our third home, a foster home in Westdene, for up to six children. This home provides stability for children who may stay long-term or are not adoptable, differing from the more transitional nature of our Melville CYCC.
                    
                    We also run a Montessori pre-school at the Westdene home, offering Early Childhood Development (ECD) with a certified Montessori teacher to prepare our children for school.
                    
                    Our dedicated care workers ensure the children receive the love, attention, and care they deserve, with oversight from our operations team and an onsite social worker.
                    
                    MOTHERS IN CRISIS We support young mothers facing unplanned pregnancies with counseling, guidance, and practical assistance.
                    
                    Our experience shows that many mothers want to keep their children but lack the necessary support. By providing professional counseling, help with identity documents, food parcels, clothing, nappies, career guidance, CV preparation, job and learnership applications, and life skills, we help prevent them from giving up their children. We also offer advice on child care, encouraging mothers to be the best parents they can be.
                    
                    SOCIAL ENTERPRISE Our social enterprise activities generate income and uplift the community through skills development and job creation. We operate three charity shops in Melville and partner with a wood workshop in Henley.
                    
                    Fight unemployment and poverty while finding amazing items at bargain prices.
                    
                    Hotel Hope Interiors: Located at 7th Street & 1st Ave, Melville, selling high-quality preloved items at bargain prices.
                    
                    Republic of Hope Charity Shop: At the corner of Main Road & 2nd Ave, Melville, offering secondhand household items and electronics.
                    
                    Hope Charity Shop: At the corner of 2nd Ave & Main Road, Melville, selling clothing, shoes, books, and various household items.
                    
                    Our charity shops have become a community project, creating eight full-time jobs and enabling financial independence for previously unemployed individuals. We support small business initiatives by selling items at reduced rates to informal traders. Donations help us fund 100% of our administrative costs, ensuring that all other contributions directly benefit Babies in Need and Mothers in Crisis.
                    
                    Donating your quality second-hand items to our shops is a win-win-win situation, providing an incentive to declutter your homes.
